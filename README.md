# 🚀 Space Habitat Designer

An interactive web app for designing autonomous space habitats for extraterrestrial environments (Mars, Moon, ISS, transit modules).

##📄 Project Overview

Space Habitat Designer is a browser-based tool that allows users to model and visualize living and working modules for space missions.
You can set habitat parameters, create and arrange functional zones, track life-support analytics, and export your design as JSON or PNG.

##✨ Features

Environment selection: Mars, Moon, ISS, or Transit Module — each with unique constraints (gravity, atmosphere, etc.)

Modular design: Set length, width, height, shape (cylinder, box, sphere), and crew size

Zoning editor: Add zones (living, labs, hygiene, kitchen, etc.), move, resize, and equip them

Analytics & validation: Automatic checks for minimum volume per crew member, required zones, and overall feasibility

Export tools: Save the design as JSON (data) or PNG (visual snapshot)

This project combines visualization with engineering logic to help users understand the real limitations of space habitat architecture.

##🧩 Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Rendering: DOM, canvas, and CSS-based layout for habitat visualization

Logic: Built-in validation and analytical calculations in JavaScript

Export: JSON serialization and PNG export for designs

Inspiration sources: NASA habitat design guides, scientific articles, and engineering reports

##📚 References

The project is inspired by real-world research, including:

NASA standards for minimum habitable volume and life-support systems

Deep Space Habitation Design Guidelines

Concepts for Mars/Moon missions and ISS modules

Scientific articles on minimum space requirements per astronaut

###Start designing habitats 🚀

##🚀 Usage Guide

Open the app and click Start Design

Enter module parameters: length, width, height, shape, crew size

Go to the zone editor: add zones (living, kitchen, hygiene, labs, etc.)

Move and resize zones inside the module

Check analytics: warnings for missing or insufficient zones

Export your project as:

JSON (data)

PNG (visual design snapshot)
